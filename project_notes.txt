Diablo 3, Markov Chains, and Theta functions

What is my goal with this project?

1.  To motivate my study of statistics.  It has drawn on conditional probabilities, Markov chains, recursions, expectations, calculus, theta functions.
2.  To develop my programming and visualization skills.  I have learned many Python tricks in preparing this.
3.  To learn about Diablo 3.

Future goals:

-  Why is the density given by a Gamma distribution?
-  Stopping time?
-  Once the mark spreads, the process can start over.  Incorporate this mechanic.  How might this addition influence the choice of p?
-  What does all of this math tell us about Diablo 3?

Project components:

- iPython Notebook
- Python/Sage code
- PDF of handwritten notes,computations

for s in range(4):
    x_dict[(1,s)] =  binomial(3,s) * p ** s * ( 1 - p ) ** ( 3 - s ) * 1.0

    for n in range(M,N):
        for s in range(0, 3 ** n + 1):
            x_dict[(n,s)] = sum([binomial(3 * r, s) * prob_spread(p,n) ** s * ( 1 - prob_spread(p,n) ) ** ( 3 * r - s ) * x_dict[(n-1,r)] for r in range( 0 , 3 ** ( n - 1 ) + 1 )])
